<h1>Convenience as a Tool for Pacification and Control: A Historical Analysis</h1>
<p>Convenience has been weaponized as a means to pacify and control the population in the United States, eroding awareness and resistance to systemic exploitation. By prioritizing ease over engagement, corporate and governmental entities have fostered an environment where regulatory protections are dismantled, wealth inequality expands, and societal alignment with universal truths is increasingly disrupted. This article traces the timeline of this phenomenon from the New Deal era to potential futures, highlighting the interplay of convenience, regulation, and societal control.</p>

<h2>Endgame</h2>
<p>The capitalist metric of convenience has been wielded as a tool for pacification and control, eroding awareness and deepening systemic inequities. From the New Deal to the hyper-convenience of the 21st century, the trajectory reveals the dangers of prioritizing ease over engagement. The Clarity Movement champions hyper-aware efficiency as the solution—a transformative approach that empowers individuals to engage meaningfully with their lives, fostering intentional simplicity, collective awareness, and the dismantling of exploitative systems. This paradigm shift will pave the way for a future rooted in clarity and universal resonance.</p>
